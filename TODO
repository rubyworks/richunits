= TODO List

== Achieve 99.9% drop-in compatability with ActiveSupport.

* Duration may be the big difficulty here.


== Better TimeZone support

* tgzinfo?


== Documentation

I was looking through the rdoc at

http://tigerops.rubyforge.org/rich_units/rdoc/index.html

and found that the names generated by rdoc for the bit and byte human readable string methods is out of synch with the examples in the documentation for each of the methods. The actual method names Numeric#strfbits and Numeric#strfbytes work but the method names Numeric#bits_to_s and Numeric#bytes_to_s that are shown in the examples for each method do not work.
