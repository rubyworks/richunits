summary: Simple LCD Unit System
title: RichUnits
version: 0.6.2
name: richunits
description: ! 'A Unit system, based on Rich Kilmer''s original time.rb work, which
  provides

  english-esque methods for working with common units, such as days and bytes

  and multiplers like kilo, or mega. It does so by reducing basic measures to

  a lower common denominator, such as seconds for time measures and bits for

  byte measures.'
