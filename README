RichUnits also includes a Duration class (inspired by Matthew Harris' version)
for storing time measures. These measure were originally stored as Integer
seconds. The Duration class instead stores the seconds as an attribute and
adds a  an optional segements property which can be used to select exactly
how to segment up the time period (years, week, days, etc.).

See RDocs for complete API documentation.
