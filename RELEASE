This release updates some extensions to Time for use with the
Duration class, and standardizes the library on the name 'richunits',
rather than using the underscored "rich_units". This means installation
is now:

  gem install richunits

and loading the library is now:

  require 'richunits'

Though a backward compatible require is still present.

The previous release contains a complete rewrite of the Duration
class and integrates it into the rest of the system.


### 0.5.0 / 2009-05-30

* Rewrote Duration class and integrated into rest of system.
