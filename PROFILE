description:
  A Unit system, based on Rich Kilmer's original time.rb work,
  which provides english-esque methods for working with common
  units, such as days and bytes and multiplers like kilo, or mega.
  It does so by reducing basic measures to a lower common denominator,
  such as seconds for time measures and bits for byte measures.
